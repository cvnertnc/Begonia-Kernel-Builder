Also see here [`CONFIG.md`](./CONFIG.md). Hello, the CONFIG.md file is old and I will not update it.

## Manager - Modules
> [!NOTE]
> You can download the manager for whatever kernel and root alternative you are using from here.
>
> I strongly recommend you to install the SUSFS module to hide root. If you want to use the Mountify Module, you can download and install it.
